Hi, I'm Kyle - an embedded software engineer with a background in computer science (BSc & MSc, UBC). This is a place to write down my thoughts on whatever I’m into — coding projects, books I’ve read, bits of history, hikes, travel, or anything that gets me outside. It’s mostly a personal blog, but if you’re here, welcome.
